## Career Summary

I'm the kind of developer who always has an eye on what's new. Staying on top of the latest tech isn't just about showing off – it's about making my work better and learning the skills that make me unstoppable. 
Usually, you'll find me crushing it in the back-end, but I'm not afraid to get my hands dirty with some front-end work too (jk...) 😂 Knowing the whole process makes me a better developer overall. 
I'm hungry to leave my mark on the industry, so if you're building something awesome and need a teammate who's always pushing forward, let's talk! 🚀
